I'll help you with the requirements and steps to run this project locally on your personal computer.

Required Programs:

Node.js - Version 18.x or higher
Download from: https://nodejs.org/
Steps to Run:

Install Node.js

Download and install Node.js from the official website
Verify installation by opening a terminal/command prompt and running:

node --version
npm --version
Project Setup

Open a terminal/command prompt
Navigate to the project directory
Install dependencies:

npm install
Start Development Server

In the same terminal, run:

npm run dev
The development server will start and you'll see a URL (typically http://localhost:5173)
Open that URL in your web browser to view the application
Additional Notes:

Make sure you have a modern web browser installed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
The project uses Vite as the development server, which provides fast hot module replacement (HMR)
All dependencies are managed through npm and will be installed automatically when you run npm install
No additional programs or global installations are required beyond Node.js
That's it! The project should now be running locally on your machine.

Connecting to a Database
The current project setup does not include any database connection. To connect to a database, you would need to:

Choose a Database: Decide on the type of database you want to use (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL).

Install Database Client: Install the appropriate database client library. For example, for MongoDB, you can use mongoose:

npm install mongoose

Create a Backend: Since this project is a frontend application, you will need a backend server to handle database operations. You can use Node.js with Express.js for this purpose.

Set Up API Endpoints: Create API endpoints in your backend to perform CRUD operations on the database.

Connect Frontend to Backend: Use fetch or a library like axios to make HTTP requests from your React components to the backend API.

Example: Connecting to MongoDB
Set Up Backend:

Create a new directory for the backend (e.g., backend).

Initialize a new Node.js project and install dependencies:

mkdir backend
cd backend
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose cors

Create a basic Express server (backend/index.js):

const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/sseed', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  birthDate: String,
  weight: Number,
  height: Number,
  email: String,
  medicalAuthorization: Boolean,
  disease: {
    general: String,
    specific: String,
    diagnosisDate: String,
    hasTreatment: Boolean,
    treatmentStartDate: String,
    treatments: [String],
    sideEffects: [String],
  },
  physicalProfile: Map,
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

app.post('/api/users', async (req, res) => {
  const user = new User(req.body);
  await user.save();
  res.status(201).send(user);
});

app.get('/api/users', async (req, res) => {
  const users = await User.find();
  res.send(users);
});

app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 5000');
});

Connect Frontend to Backend:

In your React components, use fetch or axios to make requests to the backend API.

import axios from 'axios';

const handleRegisterUser = async (userData: Omit<User, 'id'>) => {
  const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:5000/api/users', userData);
  const newUser = response.data;
  setUsers([...users, newUser]);
  setActiveTab('registered-users');
};

This is a basic example to get you started. You can expand on this by adding more endpoints, handling errors, and securing your API.
